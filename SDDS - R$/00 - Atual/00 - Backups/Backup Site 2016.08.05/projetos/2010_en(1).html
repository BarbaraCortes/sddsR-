This new category replaced the <em>Open Class</em>, but it kept the last&rsquo;s  main characteristics: there weren&rsquo;t dimensional restrictions and different options  of propulsion were allowed, since the total cylinder displacement didn&rsquo;t exceed  .65 cubic inches.</p>
					      <p>					        The great  surprise was the inclusion of a new line of project in the teams, which had to  develop a data acquisition system <strong>(DAS)</strong> in order to measure the<strong> take-off distance</strong> of the  airplane.</p>
						<p>The proper  operation of the DAS was fundamental to the success in the competition, so it  represented a great challenge to the team, whose members are, in its majority,  students of Aeronautical Engineering. So, the team decided to re-employ (with few  modifications) the project <em>EESC-USP East 2009</em>, but it included the DAS in the  airplane. The project and the construction of the DAS were held as responsibility  of a single member, student of Mechatronics Engineering.</p>

					   <p>					        The DAS  construction delayed, but in the competition&rsquo;s eve it seemed to the team that  the system was completely ready to make accurate measurements.</p>
					  <p>					        In the 1st Day  of competition, the accuracy of the DAS was measured in a simple test. The  airplane was pushed in the soil between two landmarks, and then the indicated  distance was compared to the real distance. In this test, the DAS reached an  <strong>accuracy factor of 95.3%</strong>, similar to the other teams&rsquo;.</p>
					      <p>					        In the  flight batteries, however, problems occurred in the system. In the first  attempts, the DAS didn&rsquo;t work. On the other hand, the airplane&rsquo;s performance  proved to be <strong>a lot better</strong> than the opponents&rsquo;. The airplane <em>EESC-USP Advanced</em>  flew many batteries with the maximum payload, 39.7lb (18kg), while the highest  payload of the other teams was 28lb (12.7kg).</p>
					      <p>					        After some  attempts, the DAS finally worked and the team obtained a valid flight with maximum  payload. However, the distance measured was much different from the runway length,  what affected the total score.</p>
					      <p>					        Finally,  the team obtained the <strong>2nd Place Overall</strong>, and it still obtained the awards of  <em>1st Place Most Payload</em> and <em>3rd Place Oral Presentation</em>.</p></div></td>

					  <div class="texto" align="justify"> <p>The project  for the <em>Regular Class</em> brought several innovations for the team. The regulation  of this category <strong>prohibits the usage of fiber reinforced plastics (FRPs)</strong>, it  offer bonus score for the airplanes which perform an <strong>empty flight</strong> and it doesn&rsquo;t  account  structural efficiency in the total score, focusing the payload  carried. In this competition, the teams must use the engine OS .61, and there  is also a dimensional restriction. </p>
				<p>In its  previous project, <em>EESC-USP Bravo 2009</em>, the team employed an <strong>airfoil based on  Selig 1223</strong> in the wing. The last presents an extremely thin trailing edge, what  complicates its construction and also diminishes the wing stiffness. &nbsp;The team avoided these problems modifying the airfoil  trailing edge while keeping its aerodynamics qualities, and as result the  airplane presented a good performance.</p>
					      <p>					        After wind  tunnel tests, the team proved the advantage of this airfoil compared to others  already used, like Eppler 423 and EESC-1, and it was re-employed in the wing of  the airplane <em>EESC-USP Regular</em>. Next, new materials to replace the FRPs were  researched. That study revealed to the team several materials that allow an  accurate construction and low empty weight, like aeronautical aluminum (which  can be machined), wood sheets and PVC foams (which can be laser cut), etc.</p></div></td><td width="30">&nbsp; </td>

					<p>Aiming to  comply with the restriction successfully, the team focused in the design of a  flexible cargo bay and of joints that permitted the disassembling of the plane.  The team achieved an airplane which, as seen in the picture, presents a <strong>central  rod</strong> where are fixed the engine, the landing gear, the cargo bay, the wing, the  elevator and the rudder.

					  <div class="texto" align="justify">  <p>The  airplane Alpha 2010 was an improvement of the airplane <strong>EESC-USP Regular 2010</strong>,  designed to the international competition AeroDesign East 2010.</p>
					    <p>Basically,  the team redesigned the structures of that airplane, diminished its dimensions,  introduced a brake mechanism and also designed new interfaces that permitted  the complete disassembling of the plane and its arrangement into a low volume  box.</p>
						 <p>Even with  the reduced time of Project, the team reached the <strong>3rd position</strong> in the first  phase of the competition, which accounted the Technical Report and the Oral  Presentation.</p>
					    <p>					      With the  result, the team went to the next day prepared to risk soon in the first flight  attempt, for which the plane was loaded with <strong>28.66lb (13kg)</strong> of payload. However,  problems in the landing gear impeded the take-off. For the next attempt, the  team planned to fly with lower payload, to guarantee the classification. Then,  the airplane was loaded with only <strong>22.04lb (10kg)</strong>, and it flew easily. However,  the wheel detached from the main landing gear in the landing, and the flight  was invalidated.</p></div></td>

					   <p>&nbsp;After the two failures, the team prepared to  the next flight, since it would be the <strong>last chance</strong> of classification. The  airplane was loaded with <strong>15.43lb (7kg)</strong>, it took-off, it flew and it landed  without any problem. The classification of the team provoked great commemoration  of the members.</p>
					    <p>					      Still in  the Saturday afternoon, the team had a new flight attempt, which failed due to  a strong rain that reached the runway at the moment. Then, the most loaded  flights were all postponed to the last day of competition.</p>
					    <p>					      In the Sunday,  the team started with <strong>27.56lb (12.5kg)</strong> of payload, with success. Next, the  airplane flew with <strong>28.97lb (13.14kg)</strong>. In the landing, the airplane could stop exactly  in the limit of the runway, and this battery score left the team leading the  competition! This achievement caused an euphoric commemoration of all members  of the EESC-USP Team.</p>
					    <p>					      Then, the  organizers opened a new battery for the 10 best placed team of the Regular  Class. The Alpha team planned to increase the payload lifted, intending to beat  a possible increase of the others teams&rsquo; scoring. &nbsp;In the battery, the <strong>Tucano</strong> team, from UFU, flew  with nearly 31lb (14kg) and it still obtained the bonus for stopping in the  landing.</p>
					    <p>					      The flight  of the <strong>Alpha</strong> team was extremely exciting. After the take-off, the airplane  hardly gained altitude and it flew few centimeters from the ground. After some  while, the plane could reach some meters of altitude, and then approached to land.  In the landing, the airplane touched the wheels in the beginning of the runway,  it bounced, and it returned to the ground 100ft (30.5m) forward, impeding the  stop before the limit of 200ft (61m).</p>
					    <p>					      Then, the  team Alpha 2010 finished in <strong>2nd Place Overall</strong>, after the winner Tucano, from  UFU, and both teams will represent Brazil in the <em>Regular Class</em> of the<em> AeroDesign East</em> competition.</p></div></td>
